- The CLI should also also expose the command 'gemi' which reads the --file_prompt and/or --prompt args (appending prompt string to the contents of file_prompt), then and calls `google_gemini_ask` or if --deep is given it calls `google_gemini_ask_deep_think` and outputs the result to --output_file or to stdout
