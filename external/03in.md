The @02ana/ folder contains various files, and the file @02ana.txt contains a synopsis of the files in the folder.

Our objective is to create a modular python package 'playpi' which

- uses 'playwrightauthor' to automate the browser to perform various actions, 
- wraps these actions into simple accessible functions. 
- one example to implement is `google_deep_research(input_prompt: str) -> str` —— look at @01in/playwright-google-deep-research.py
