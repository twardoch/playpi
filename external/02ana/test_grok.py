## File Description

This Python script is a command-line interface for querying multiple AI APIs simultaneously. Here's what it does:

### What it does:
- Uses multiprocessing to potentially run queries in parallel
- Queries AI services (Grok on X/Twitter and You.com) about typography-related topics
- Calls a core function `ask_topics()` that handles multiple topics across different APIs
- Prints formatted answers from these AI services to the console

### How it works:
1. **Multiprocessing setup**: Uses `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` for compatibility with frozen executables
2. **API instantiation**: Creates instances of `AskGrokOnX` and `AskYouCom` classes with verbose logging options
3. **Topic management**: Defines a list of typography-related topics (mostly commented out except for two active ones)
4. **Query execution**: The `ask()` function calls `ask_topics()` with the topics and specified API
5. **Result formatting**: Prints each answer with clear separators for readability

### Why
