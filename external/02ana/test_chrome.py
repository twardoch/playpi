### **Explanation and Description of the File**

#### **What It Does**
This file is a Python script that uses the `undetected_chromedriver` (a fork of Selenium) to automate a Google search. It initializes a Chrome browser instance that bypasses basic bot detection, navigates to Google, locates the search bar, types a query, submits it, waits for the search results to load, and logs the page title.

#### **How It Works**
1. **Logging Setup**:
   - The script sets up Python's `logging` module to provide debug-level output, tracking each major step in the automation process.

2. **SSL Context Configuration**:
   - `ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context` disables SSL verification. This is sometimes used to avoid certificate-related errors when accessing websites, though it can pose security risks.

3. **Chrome Options Configuration**:
   - It configures Chrome to:
     - Start maximized.
     - Enable verbose logging.
     - Set log level to `0` (most verbose).

4. **Driver Initialization**:
   - `undetected_chromedriver` is initialized using the configured options. This version of Selenium is designed to avoid detection by websites that block bots.

5. **Browser Automation**:
   - The script:
     - Navigates to `https://www.google.com`.
     - Waits for the search bar (`<input name="q">`) to appear.
     - Sends a search query: `"undetected_chromedriver"`.
     - Submits the form.
     - Waits for the search results container (`<div id="search">`) to load.
     - Logs the page title.

6. **Error Handling and Cleanup**:
   - It wraps the automation logic in a `try-except-finally` block:
     - Catches and logs any exceptions.
     - Ensures the browser is closed in the `finally` block.

### **Analysis in the Context of the 'playpi' Package Objective**

#### **Objective Recap**
You want to create a modular Python package called **`playpi`** that uses **Playwright** (not Selenium) to automate browser actions, wrapping them into **simple, accessible functions** for tasks like:
- Opening an LLM chat window.
- Sending a prompt.
- Retrie
