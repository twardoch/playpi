# Work Progress Report

## Completed Tasks - Session 2025-09-28

### Fixed Syntax Errors and Import Issues
- ✅ Fixed syntax error in `tests/test_google_gemini.py` line 107 (missing newline after with statement)
- ✅ Fixed syntax error in `tests/test_google_gemini.py` line 131 (missing backslashes for line continuation)
- ✅ Fixed syntax error in `tests/test_google_gemini.py` line 161 (missing backslashes for line continuation)
- ✅ Fixed import error in `tests/test_google_provider.py` (changed `google_deep_research` to `google_gemini_deep_research`)

### Test Results
- **Status**: Tests now run successfully with async support
- **Issue discovered**: `uvx hatch test` doesn't load pytest-asyncio properly
- **Workaround**: Use `uvx hatch run test:python -m pytest` for running async tests
- **Test Coverage**: 26 tests collected, syntax errors resolved
- **Async Tests**: Now properly supported with pytest-asyncio plugin

### Technical Findings
- pytest-asyncio is properly installed in test environment (version 1.2.0)
- Configuration includes `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pyproject.toml
- Plugin loads correctly when run through `python -m pytest`
- Issue appears to be with hatch's pytest invocation method

## Current Status
- All syntax errors fixed
- Import errors resolved
- Tests can run successfully through proper command
- Ready to proceed with CLI updates and final validation

## Next Items
- Update CLI to implement new commands per issues/105.md
- Run comprehensive test validation
- Complete refactoring verification
