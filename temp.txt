**Understanding the Context**

I've initiated the research. I'm starting with a general Google search for "Adam 
Twardoch" to get the lay of the land, understanding his main affiliations and 
professional profile. From there, I'll dive deeper into his areas of expertise.

**Exploring Specific Contributions**

I've refined my initial search. After the broad "Adam Twardoch" search, I'm now drilling 
down. I'm focusing on his font design work and his involvement with FontLab. I'll search 
for "Adam Twardoch fonts," "Adam Twardoch typography," "Adam Twardoch FontLab," and 
historical aspects of his FontLab role. This will provide a more detailed understanding 
of his significant contributions to the field.

**Gathering Initial Insights**

I've started exploring Adam Twardoch's background. A quick Google search confirms his 
role as Director of Products at Font Lab and his consulting work with some big names. It 
seems like a good starting point for learning more about his expertise and contributions 
in the field.

**Refining the Search Strategy**

I've learned that the initial search mix is a bit noisy, requiring some refinement. I now
see the value in separating Adam Twardoch from Szczepan Twardoch. I'll focus on his 
FontLab role, OpenType contributions, and specific font technologies. This targeted 
approach should yield a clearer picture of his expertise and key contributions.
